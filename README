A Flink application project using Scala and SBT. My work on the exercises from https://dataartisans.github.io/flink-training/index.html.

Notes
-----

* To run and test your application use SBT invoke: 'sbt run'
* In order to run your application from within IntelliJ, you have to select the classpath of the 'mainRunner' module in the run/debug configurations. Simply open 'Run -> Edit configurations...' and then select 'mainRunner' from the Use classpath of module dropbox.
